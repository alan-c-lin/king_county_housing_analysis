# Figures

This folder contains exported plots from the King County Housing Analysis project. 

Figures 1-8 correspond to comparisons of Gaussian and bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for each feature, and figure 9 shows the first 50 Jackknife+ predicted intervals with predicted values from linear regression.

Figures are mainly included for reference; all plots are already embedded in the R Markdown outputs (`.html` and `.pdf`).
